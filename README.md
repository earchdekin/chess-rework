# chess-rework
Reworking a chess game I made in the summer with the understanding of OOP principles

This was more of a personal project that I wanted to finally finish after learning some new techniques to coding in class.
It's also a testament to how my problem solving skills have progressed, as I have been able to find simpler solutions to issues such as moving a piece and detecting if it has been blocked
